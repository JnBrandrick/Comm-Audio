TO GET THIS TO WORK:
=======================

add libvlccore.lib and libvlc.lib to this directory.
you will also need a test audio file.

If you already have VLC installed on your computer:

navigate to C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC\sdk\lib
pull the lib files from there.

you will also need to add 
C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC to your environment variable path
